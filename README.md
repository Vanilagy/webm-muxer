# ⚠️ This library is deprecated ⚠️

webm-muxer has been deprecated in favor of [Mediabunny](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny), which entirely supersedes it. Mediabunny ships with an even better, easier-to-use, faster and more feature-rich WebM multiplexer, as well as muxers for many other formats, demuxers, WebCodecs abstractions and more, while keeping the bundle size tiny thanks to a tree-shakable design.

webm-muxer is no longer being maintained and will not receive any new features or bug fixes.

## I just want to create a WebM file.

[Mediabunny](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny) has got you covered. Refer to the following documents to jump right in:

- [Guide: Writing media files](https://mediabunny.dev/guide/writing-media-files)
- [Quick start: Create new media files](https://mediabunny.dev/guide/quick-start#create-new-media-files)

## My code already uses webm-muxer. What should I do?

No worries. You can easily [migrate to Mediabunny](./MIGRATION-GUIDE.md) in 10 minutes.

If you still need the docs for webm-muxer, you can find them [here](https://github.com/Vanilagy/webm-muxer/blob/a77076a0f5c8245bbc5d387eb5aaaf065cd84f90/README.md).
